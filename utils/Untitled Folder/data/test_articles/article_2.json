  "title": "Apple Innovation Stalls as iPhone Sales Plummet 30%",
  "content": "\n        Apple reported a devastating 30% drop in iPhone sales this quarter, marking the company's worst performance in over a decade. Consumer interest in the iPhone 15 has been described as \"alarmingly low\" by industry analysts, with widespread complaints about lack of innovation and premium pricing. The company has delayed its highly anticipated mixed reality headset for the third time due to \"significant technical challenges.\" CEO Tim Cook faced hostile questions during the earnings call, with one analyst asking if Apple had \"lost its innovative edge.\" Several key executives have departed in recent months, including the head of product design and chief technology officer, creating leadership turmoil. Competitors like Samsung and Google have gained substantial market share with their latest devices featuring cutting-edge AI capabilities that Apple lacks. The company has also announced a hiring freeze and potential layoffs affecting up to 8,000 employees as cost-cutting measures. Apple stock has declined 25% year-to-date, underperforming the broader tech sector by a wide margin.\n        "
