Consumer interest in the iPhone 15 has been described as \"alarmingly low\" by industry analysts, with widespread complaints about lack of innovation and premium pricing.

The company has also announced a hiring freeze and potential layoffs affecting up to 8,000 employees as cost-cutting measures. Apple stock has declined 25% year-to-date, underperforming the broader tech sector by a wide margin.\n        "
